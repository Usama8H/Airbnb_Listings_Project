A simple ELT project pulling Airbnb data.

Data was extracted into an S3 Bucket. From here it was transfered into Snowflake. 
DBT was used to clean up and transform the data. Ensuring that the neccessary tests and packages were used for this.

Dashboard was produced using preset highlighting number of hosts, new listings, distribution of super hosts, price distribution and the effects of the full moon.
